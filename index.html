                <p>Achievers is a mid-sized company that offers a recognition platform to improve employee engagement
                  for its clients (B2B). I'm constantly learning about microservices architecture and best practices in
                  Python (microservices), PHP (original monolith), and Javascript (React microfrontend). During my time
                  in Achievers, I am:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Leading the encryption of vital data of our platform. This has involved thorough coordination with
                    InfoSec and SRE teams to verify that our encryption keys and data migration protocols were adequate
                    and compliant with all of our internal policies. I had to design and implement a CRON job in PHP
                    that executes the migration of 15 million unencrypted MySQL records by batches. The most important
                    part of this massive learning experience has been acquiring the skills to structure and break down a
                    massive project into various tasks and sub-tasks that eventually reflect on atomic but meaningful
                    Github Pull Requests.

                    Supporting the Colombian hiring efforts. I successfully referred 2 candidates that are performing
                    excellently in their day to day duties. Also, before recently hiring a Talent Acquisition Manager, I
                    had last meetings in the recruitment processes with candidates found by Canadian recruiters. My main
                    responsibility was clearing up any doubts and showing enthusiasm regarding the company.

                  <li>
                    Accompanied the expansion of the company’s operations to the Caribbean Coast. I verified that the
                    orders were processed correctly through the platform. This meant that, sometimes, I had to go to the
                    warehouse where the packers were preparing the bags of lettuce, for example. It was an opportunity
                    for me to learn how to communicate technical concepts to people without that kind of literacy. We
                    were able to track the packing progress through this software, which allowed us to have better data
                    transparency and take iterative actions to improve the whole flow.

                    satisfaction was adapting our integration with Alegra, an accounting and billing platform.
                    Initially, the platform was only interacting with 1 API account. The idea was to open an account for
                    each operating city around the country so that they could operate as independently as possible. The
                    satisfaction came from being able to make the correct adaptations to the platform, causing not a
                    single issue from the users' side, who in this case were the purchasing managers from each city and
                    founders of the company.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Attending the labs with the students every week to clarify any doubts about the workshops. In these
                    labs, students would implement structures like arraylists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees,
                    heaps and graphs. They all had to be unit tested accordingly to then be applied in 3 practical
                    projects.

                    Mentoring students' groups (of 2 members) towards how to collaborate both on a human and technical
                    level. On the human side, I recall having to convince a student that it was better to learn now how
                    to work with peers and not crash with the harsh realities and frustrations that he would eventually
                    encounter in further courses and his professional life. On a technical level, this course was also
                    the excuse to expose students to how Git worked through Gitlab, so I had to accompany those first
                    steps.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>My proudest accomplishment was creating a semester ending bonus exercise where the students had to
                  parse a .txt file that illustrated a maze. The parsing had to lead to the generation of a graph that
                  had to be traversed using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from start to finish.
                  Finally, they had to test the program against several test inputs because it involved a session of
                  defending the solution and testing it against cases provided by me.</p>

      <h3>Model as a Service: an architecture to deploy highly modular IT services</h3>
      <h4>Universidad de los Andes - July 2022</h4>
      <p>With the constant development of startups dedicated to use cutting edge algorithms and large data manipulation
        methods to solve complex business problems, the provided services become more disconnected from the final
        client. A need arises to make it easier for the customer to execute and customize the tools made available for
        it. On the other hand, the developers should also organize their code in a way that enables the needed
        customization. The modeler must be capable of easily building complex services based on pre-built unitary
        modules, each with a self-contained purpose. The solution designed in this context is a MaaS (Model as a
        Service) and, by definition, also a SaaS (Software as a Service). In it, the developers create the unitary
        modules that would be consumed by the bigger IT services offered to the client. The modelers, then, have to
        create a console so that the customer seamlessly generates its own endpoints to consume. By developing a
        prototype of the platform, it was proven that it is possible to have an architecture that guides the creation
        and execution of programming models with the given requirements. The architecture was able to execute a service
        by using 2 unitary services. Therefore, the platform supports 2 different levels of customization: singular, by
        passing parameters to one module, and plural, by joining more than one module.</p>
